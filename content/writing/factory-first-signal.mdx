# Factory-First Signal Architecture

The textile industry is waking up to the power of real-time data. But most RFID implementations fail because they treat the factory as an afterthought.

## The Problem

Traditional approaches start with the cloud and work backwards:
1. Design the API first
2. Figure out how to get data there
3. Hope the factory can keep up

This creates fragile systems that break under real-world conditions.

## The Factory-First Approach

Start with the factory floor and build up:

### 1. Edge Processing
- Process signals at the source
- Handle network interruptions gracefully
- Provide immediate feedback to operators

### 2. Reliable Sync
- Queue-based architecture for offline resilience
- Conflict resolution for multi-site deployments
- Incremental sync to minimize bandwidth

### 3. Real-time Dashboard
- WebSocket connections for live updates
- Progressive enhancement for slow connections
- Mobile-first design for floor workers

## Implementation

```typescript
// Edge device signal processing
class RFIDProcessor {
  async processSignal(tag: string, timestamp: number) {
    // Local validation and processing
    const event = await this.validateAndProcess(tag, timestamp);
    
    // Queue for sync
    await this.queueForSync(event);
    
    // Immediate local feedback
    this.updateLocalDisplay(event);
  }
}
```

## Key Principles

1. **Resilience First**: Design for network failures
2. **Local Feedback**: Operators need immediate response
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Works offline, better online
4. **Mobile Native**: Factory workers use phones, not laptops

## Results

Systems built this way achieve:
- 99.9% uptime even with poor connectivity
- Sub-second response times for operators
- Seamless multi-site synchronization
- Easy maintenance and updates

The factory floor isn't just a data sourceâ€”it's your primary user interface.
